# Learning Journal
## Description
A learning journal web application. The main (index) page lists journal entry titles and dates. Each journal entry title links to a detail page that displays the title, date, time spent, the journal entry, and resources related to the learning.

The application lets the user add or edit journal entries. When adding or editing a journal entry, the application prompts the user for title, date, time spent, what they learned, and resources to remember.
